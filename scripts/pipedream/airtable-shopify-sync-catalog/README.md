# Airtable → Shopify catalog sync (Pipedream)

Triggered when a **Print** enters the **Committed** view in the Operations Airtable base. Syncs that print and its linked entities to Shopify, then marks the linked artist and collections as Committed in Airtable.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Airtable base** | [Operations (appC7O4qp56Rdaj7c)](https://airtable.com/appC7O4qp56Rdaj7c) |
| **Shopify store** | `thelonglookco.myshopify.com` |
| **Pipedream workflow** | [airtable-shopify-sync-catalog](https://pipedream.com/@thelonglook/projects/proj_Vbs7LgY/airtable-shopify-sync-catalog-p_n1CGZzK/build) |

Order sync (Shopify → Airtable) is a **separate workflow** — see [`../shopify-airtable-sync-orders/`](../shopify-airtable-sync-orders/).

## Flow

```
Airtable trigger: Prints → Committed view (new record)
        ↓
1. Load Variants catalog (shared product options)
2. Sync linked Artist → Shopify artist metaobject
3. Sync linked Collections → Shopify collection metaobjects
4. Sync Print → picture metaobject + product
5. Prune Shopify products/pictures not in Airtable Committed view
6. Write back Artist Status → Commited (Airtable typo on Artists/Collections)
7. Write back Collection Status → Commited
```

Re-running is safe: Shopify entities are upserted by **Airtable record ID** (with handle fallback for legacy rows). Handles/titles can change in Airtable without creating duplicates. Prints removed from the Committed view (or deleted from Airtable) are removed from Shopify on the next sync run.

### Airtable ID fields (one-time Shopify setup)

Run once to add schema fields the sync writes:

```bash
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_… node scripts/add-airtable-record-id-fields.mjs
```

| Shopify object | Field |
|----------------|-------|
| Product | metafield `airtable.record_id` |
| Artist / Collection / Picture metaobject | field `airtable_record_id` |

## Pipedream setup

1. **Trigger:** Airtable → **New or Modified Records in View** → Prints table → **Committed** view  
   (Do **not** use “New Records in View” — that only fires for newly created rows, not Status changes.)
2. **Action:** Use the published action `thelonglook-airtable-shopify-sync-catalog` (latest: `sc_v4ix1Rzg`) — **replace** any inline AI-generated code step; the REST API cannot update inline workflow code in place.
3. Connect **airtable_oauth** and **Shopify** on the **action step** (same account as trigger; trigger connection alone is not enough)
4. For Shopify, **Shopify (Key Required)** works — Shop ID `thelonglookco` + your `shpat_` token
5. Leave **Print record ID** blank in workflows (`{{steps.trigger.event.id}}` is only needed for isolated step tests)
6. Test with **Dry run** = `true` first, then **Deploy**

Required Shopify scopes: `read/write_metaobjects`, `read/write_products`, `read/write_publications`, `read/write_files`

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `script.js` | Trigger handler — one print per run |
| `config.js` | Airtable field mappings and Shopify settings |
| `utils.js` | API clients, transforms, and entity sync functions |

## Local E2E test

```bash
AIRTABLE_PAT=pat… SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_… \
  node scripts/pipedream/run-catalog-sync-e2e.mjs recJjzHivCkA6IgnR
```

Add `--dry-run` to simulate without writes.
